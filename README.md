# efficient-l-test_python
Implemented Python version of https://github.com/SSouhardya/l-test - R-based \ell-test, integrating Adelie's efficient LASSO with 5-fold cross-validation, warm start capabilities for 10+ regularization paths, and single-run LASSO, achieving 3x speedup over scikit-learn's implementation.
